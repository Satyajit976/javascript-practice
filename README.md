---:Introduction to JavaScript:---

->JavaScript is a high level programming language for building web-application more efficiently.

->JavaScript works on both client side as well as server side rendering.

->JavaScript comes from echma script, so we see the latest version of the JvaScript in the form of echma script(ES).

->Now, we use JavaScript version 6 i.e;(ES6).

->In other way, we called ES6 as the vanilla JavaScript.

->JavaScript is aminly used for building logics or functionality of a webpages.

--:VARIABLES:--
->It is a container to store some data.

->There are 3 types of variables present in JavaScript:-

    1.let: 
            -It is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable name later.
            -Now, most of the cases we use 'let' for creating variables.
            -'let' is a block scope code so we have been using 'let' for most cases.

    2.var:
            -It is a type of variable which is alsoused for changing variable on later stage.
            -It is used in oldesr browser, so now it is not use as it is.

    3.const:
            -It is a type of variable where we cann't cahnge our data further.
            -It means constant to store some data like numbers, integers, etc...

--:Rules For Creating Variables Names:--
    -Variable names are case sensetive 'a',& 'A' is different.
    -Only letter, underscore and $ is allowed(no space).
    -Only letter, underscore and $ should be the 1st character.
    -Reserved words cann't be variables.
